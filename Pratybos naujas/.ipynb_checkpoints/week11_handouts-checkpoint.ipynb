    "- `count` returns an infinite sequence from a starting number by a set step\n",
    "- `cycle` repeats elements of an iterable\n",
    "- `repeat` repeats the same value infinite times\n",
    "\n",
    "Some finite itertools:\n",
    "- `accumulate` sums values of an iterable (like a cumulative sum)\n",
    "- `chain` joins multiple finite iterables into a single iterator\n",
    "- `zip_longest` zips two iterables and fills the missing values by a specified placeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tools for combinatorics:\n",
    "- `product` generates all possible combinations of a specified length of two input iterables\n",
    "- `permutations` generates permutations without repeats, order matters\n",
    "- `combinations` generates combinations without repeats of the same value, order doesn't matter\n",
    "- `combinations_with_replacement` generates combinations with repeats, order doesn't matter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Excercises\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a bag with 5 red and 5 blue tokens. They can be taken out one by one. Without using combinatoric formulas, get all possible ways to take out these tokens, then calculate the probability that 3th, 4th and 5th tokens will be red.\n",
    "2. Write a simple program which takes `input()` from a user. First, the user is asked to provide comma-separated names, then comma-separated numbers. After that, the program should output text formatted as a table with two columns, where first column contain names, and another one - numbers. Make sure to include all provided values.\n",
    "3. Write an infinite generator for a Fibonnaci sequence. Print out the first 20 elements.\n",
    "4. Using the provided example (with `class`), design a custom iterator that creates a converging sequence. The rule for the next element is $a_{n} = (n + 1)/2n^2$"
