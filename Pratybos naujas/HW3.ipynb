    "Some researchers who collected data for the Snail Lab complained that measuring a sample takes a lot of time and is quite difficult. Sometimes snails are found on single leaves, not on whole plants, making several measurements impossible to make. Moreover, one should be careful when measuring snail features, because if they hide inside their shell, the researcher is forced to wait until the snail fully appears again.\n",

    "An intern from the Snail Lab suggested that they could use AI to solve this issue. After several discussions, they decided to train a model which would predict the genus of a snail from only easy-to-measure features. The intern prepared some useful data but then got sick. So, the Snail Lab asks for your help once more.\n",
